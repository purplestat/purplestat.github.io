# About
 Hey there and welcome to my little data analytics sandpit. I'm quite enthousiastic about data and the possibility to extrapolate meaningful patterns and visualize insights in a concise way.
				I do most of the analysis you see in:
				* **R** %>% Rmarkdown %>% tidyr/dplyr/data.table %>% caret %>% ggplot2/htmlwidgets/leaflet %>% Shiny
				* SELECT * FROM **mySQL**
				*
