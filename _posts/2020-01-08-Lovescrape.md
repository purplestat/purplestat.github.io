In this quick webscraping project I tried to investigate a few gender related stereotypes. I made use of the publicly available information about gender, height, age and the corresponding preferences on one of the major german online dating platforms. 

It can be seen that the balance between genders is strongly tilted. Especially men in the thirties are highly overrepresented. Since the own age is self reported variable the true age might differ.

Comparing the self reported age to the stated desired age range of a potential match provides an interesting result. Women tend to prefer on average slightly older men until they are in their fifties. Thereafter the preference inverts to slightly younger ones.

In contrast, men seem to aim for slightly younger women.

A similar comparison is done for the stated height of both genders. It is not too surprising that the height distribution of men has a larger mean than the female counterpart.

Similarly as before, men tend to desire women that are smaller while women prefer taller men.
