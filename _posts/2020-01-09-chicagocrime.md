title: "Robberies under the veil of darkness"
summary: "{I investigate how darkness affects the crime rates in chicago}"

In many TV-shows and crime movies, robberies predominantly take place during the late evening hours and happen often in shady and abandoned backalleys. I was wondering whether this hollywood depiction actually reassemlbes 
the truth or should rather be seen as a dramaturgic element since darkness is usually associated with the evil.
Despite this element, there are good reasons to believe that crime rates might changing troughout the day: For each robbery there needs to be an accessible victim. If everybody is asleep  On the one hand, 
since the criminal does not want to experience any interference of outsiders. On the other hand, the veil of darkness might help to approach a victim but also to vanish after the crime is done. 

The following two figures provide an overview of the location and historical development of robberies.
While Austin pretty noticable in it's number of robberies. Important to note that it's also one of the bigger areas that is densly populated.

In gerneal, robberies seem to steadly declined over the last years. While the frequency of monthly robberies was around 1500 at the start of the century it decreased by roughly 50 percent to about 750 at the end of 2019.

If you are particularily interested in this aspect you might want to have a look at a [report about the Chicago Police Department](https://abc7chicago.com/robberies-down-19-percent-citywide-in-2018-chicago-police-say/4974400/)
 and their strategic approach. However, I don't want to put too much emphasis on the general decline of robberies but rather focus on the cyclicality of robberies over the day. The subsequent graph shows the strong variation in robberies over the day. The frequency of robberies has it's low around 6am in the morning and increases throught the day until the peak around 9pm. The discrepancy is quite pronounced since the number of robberies at 6am are more than three times lower than at 9pm.
